# Fix My Code Challenge

## Background Context

Hello there! Welcome to my "Fix My Code Challenge" project. This is a unique kind of project where I dive into an existing codebase to fix it, rather than building something from scratch. It's an exciting journey, as sometimes I'm familiar with the programming language being used, and other times, not so much.

## The Challenge

The challenge here is not to recode everything. The aim is to identify the issues in the existing code and fix them. It's all about debugging and problem-solving!
